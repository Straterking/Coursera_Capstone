In the case of Injury collisions that would mean an increase in hospital admissions and because of  the limited capacity, trauma centres will now be overwhelmed. In the case of property damage it may result in the state being held liable even in the event of the motorists being in the wrong because of the lighting conditions of the streets which may be exsistent and malfunctioning and non-exisitent at all. The state could also be held accountable for not diplaying appropriate signage that gives warning of adverse road conditions. \n"

So by being able to predict the severity of collisions firstly by locations that are deemed to be hotspots and prone to accidents and then looking at other factors that may have a high correletation with the severity of the collisions, would change the outlook on the severity in the different locations. This analysis would have a high probability in reducing the number of collisions and the impact they have in the city metropol in the future. "

    "After Data cleaning the dataset is left with 194 673 samples and 15 features. For the categorical data to be used in the feature set I used the one hot encoding technique to convert categorical variables to binary variables and appended them to the feature set Data Frame. For each feature I looked at the different correlations of the feature to the depebdent variable in question, in this case Severity. For the weather feature I looked at the different weather condition distributions and removed the unknown and other category which could give a bias in the machine learning process (**Table1**). For the road condition feature I looked at the different road condition distributuions and removed the other and unknown category (**Table1**). For the lighting condition I follwed suit with the same process and removed the unknown and other categories (**Table1**).

The first feature is **UNDERINFL** whic is defined in the Data section as a flag for under influence. The feature was scrambled with both categorical and numerical values with N having 100274 samples and 0  having 80394 samples whilst the other pairing of Y having 5126 samples and 1 having 3995 samples. After converting the categorical data to numerical values it is apparent that 95% of the collisions that occur in the city metropol are of individuals that are not under the influence. With the majority of that proportion resulting in a Property Damage Only Collision. See the figure below."

    "The Second feature I am going to be exploring is the **HITPARKEDCAR** attribute which is decribed in the Data section as a flag for collision on parked cars. This feature is entirely a categorical variable with a Y samples of 7216 and N samples of 187457. I convert the values into numerical values of 1 for the Y samples and 0 for the N samples respectively. The representation of this data shows that 96% of the collisions that occur involve cars that are in motion with over 120000 of the samples resulting in Property Damage Only Collision. See figure below."

I am going to look at the top 100 locations that had the most occurances of collision incidents in order of the highest and depict the datframe in a map visualization. First I am going to create a seperate dataframe with location information that is inclusive of the physical address and the cordinates. Then I create a **COUNT** attribute which looks at the number of occurances of the unique location and finish the data cleaning process by removing duplicate and missing values."

    "The Feature set that I am goin to be using to predict the severity of collisions will consist of the **WEATHER**, **ROADCOND** and the **LIGHTCOND** . These features are defined as the  weather at the day of the collission, the condition of the road on the day of the collision and the lighting condition on the day of the collision respectively. As I mentioned in the Data section that I will be using the one hot encoding technique to convert categorical variables to binary variables and append them to the feature set Data Frame. Lets start looking at the **WEATHER** feature and the correlations the feature has with the dependent variable **SEVERITYDESC**. It seems most of the information is highly useful except for the Other and Unknown weather conditions."

    "in this section I will be reporting on the outcome of the Methodology section. We will start with the Exploratory data analysis features that have been used in this report which are **UNDERINFL** , **HITPARKEDCAR** and **LOCATION**. The data for the **UNDERINFL**  feature was scrambled with categorical and numerical  values so the dataframe and the bar charts depicted the seperation. The feature had N samples of 100274, 0 samples of 80394, Y samples of 5126 and 1 samples 3995. Although the representation of the data is seperated, the definitions of the (N,0) and (Y,1) are the same. In the case of the Y and N samples, the N samples have a majority of 95% whilst in the other case 0 samples have  the same majority of 95%. The year trend analysis for the (N,0) pairing shows that there is a downward trend in collisions  from 2005 - 2010 period then a light peak from 2010 - 2013 period then there is a continuos drop from 2013 - 2020 period. For the minority class pairing (Y,1) it shows the same trend for the 2005 - 2010 period, the 2010 - 2013 period then from 2013 - 2016 period it drops and peaks slightly in 2016 and remains constant until 2020. The second feature **HITPARKEDCAR** is a much more straightforward categorical variable which I converted into a numerical values of 187457 samples of 0 and 7216 samples of 1. The 0 sample year trend analysis shows that there is a downward trend in collisions  from 2005 - 2010 period then a light peak from 2011 - 2013 period then there is a continuos drop from 2013 - 2020 period. The 1 sample year trend analysis shows that collisions started from 2013 and remained constant until 2017 and increased in 2017 and remained constant until 2020. The third feature I looked at is **LOCATION** and the impact of the top 100 collision incidents in the city. The location with the most collision incidents was N NORTHGATE WAY BETWEEN MERIDIAN AVE N AND CORLISS AVE N with 265 incidents. In the Predictive modelling section I used 4 algorithims on the imbalanced dataset and balanced data set and evaluated the models with a test set. For the imbalanced dataset the algorithims scored **69%** for KNN, **70%** for Decision Tree, **70%**  for SVM and **70%** for LogisticRegression. For the balanced data sets I used 2 approaches, upsampling the minority class and downsampling the majority class. For the upsampling approach the models scored **40%** for KNN, **48%** for the Decision Tree, **55%** for SVM\tand **68%** for LogisticRegression. The downsampling approach for the models scored **43%** for KNN, **50%** for Decision Tree, **51%** for SVM\tand **69%** for LogisticRegression."

    "The outcomes from the Exploratory data analysis suggest that there is a strong correlation betweeen the yearly trend analysis for **UNDERINFL** 0 samples and the **HITPARKEDCAR** 0 samples which follow the same period patterns. The map visual representation of the **LOCAION** suggests that the majority of the collision incidents occur in the Central business district, University street, Belltown and along Ranier Ave South getting into the Central business district. This information suggests that there could be heavy traffic and congestion getting into and around the central business district which could also be supported by the trend of the **HITPARKEDCAR** 1 samples trend. The outcomes from the Predictive modelling suggest that the imbalanced data sets model accuracy for the Decision Tree, SVM and Logistic Regression models is desirable but because of the majority class (**Property Damage Only Collision**) all these models could create a bias. This is because the majority class constitutes **70%** of the data set and could skew model accuarcy towards biasness.The best models to implement are from the balanced data set test. The results from the downsampled data set evaluation suggest that the LogisticRegression model performs the best with the highest accuracy."

    "In conclusion, to reduce the number of collision incidents in and around the Central business district the state could impose more regulation and traffic police presence. Another option would be to impose a heavy fine for collisions that result in **Property Damage Only Collision**. The model accuracy for the LogisticRegression algorithim can be improved by adding more features that could have a higher correlation with the **SEVERITYDESC** feature. Other Tree based algorithims such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees could be used to try and predict the severity of the collisions . "
