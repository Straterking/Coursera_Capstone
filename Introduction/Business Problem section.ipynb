These collisions will directly result in either an Injury or property damage. In the case of Injury collisions that would mean an increase in hospital admissions and because of  the limited capacity, trauma centres will now be overwhelmed. In the case of property damage it may result in the state being held liable even in the event of the motorists being in the wrong because of the lighting conditions of the streets which may be exsistent and malfunctioning and non-exisitent at all. The state could also be held accountable for not diplaying appropriate signage that gives warning of adverse road conditions. \n"

So by being able to predict the severity of collisions firstly by locations that are deemed to be hotspots and prone to accidents and then looking at other factors that may have a high correletation with the severity of the collisions, would change the outlook on the severity in the different locations. This analysis would have a high probability in reducing the number of collisions and the impact they have in the city metropol in the future. "
